# DPS-kun
A Discord bot for rhythm game communities.

# Deployment

1. Clone the project (`git clone <project_url>`)
2. Install the latest Node.js and Node Project Manager (NPM) versions
3. Install the runtime dependencies (`npm install --production`)
4. Define the environment variables (see `example.env` for necessary variables)
5. Run the command `npm start`

Just invite the bot to the desired Discord server and the bot is fully operational.

# Development Instructions

## Cloning (for the first time)

- Please run `git clone --recursive <project url>` instead of the standard `git clone <project_url>`.
    - This is because DPS-kun relies on the Rhythm Game CSVs repository: https://github.com/Michael-A-Berger/Rhythm-Game-CSVs
